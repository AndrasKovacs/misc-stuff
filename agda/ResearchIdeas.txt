- Chapman et al's Big Step normalization extended to dependent types

- Normal forms for dependent TT with typed indices:
  - Without PI types, only vars, U and EL (otherwise: coherence problem)

- TT in TT / NbE work
  - add universe
  - decidable equality for NbE normal forms
  - just go through it, reimplement parts

- Vague:
  - think about hacks for recursively indexed families
