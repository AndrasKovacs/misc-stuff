  prim arrays / bytearrays

  trie-vector:
    4 variants by boxity and 8/16 node size
    
  small utf8 text (maybe as special bytearray?)
  
  small ByteArray bitset
  
  crazy HAMT:
    4 variant by boxity of keys/values
    1 variant: specialized to bytearray values (so: including small text)
      (+ 2 low priority variants: specialized to small/big boxed arrays)
